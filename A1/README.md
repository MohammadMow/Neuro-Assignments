## Neuroscience Homework 1
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for the first homework assignment in the Neuroscience, Learning, Memory, and Cognition course at Sharif University of Technology.

# Overview
The homework has two main parts:

1. Python/Data Analysis Skills
  - Practice basic Python coding and data analysis techniques commonly used in neuroscience.

2. Neuron Modeling 
  - Get familiarized with common neuron models covered in the course through coding exercises.

# Part 1 - Python/Data Analysis
This section contains exercises to:

- Describe the Fourier Transform and demonstrate its use for frequency analysis on sample time series data.
