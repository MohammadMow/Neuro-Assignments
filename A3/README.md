## Neuroscience Homework 3
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for the first homework assignment in the Neuroscience, Learning, Memory, and Cognition course at Sharif University of Technology.

This assignment explores the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal model and its bifurcation behavior. It consists of six questions, each addressing specific aspects of the model and its dynamics. The questions cover variable and parameter descriptions, equilibrium points, stability analysis, branching behavior with varying input, the existence of limit cycles, and the effect of modifying one of the equations.

Additionally, the assignment delves into the Zin-Goh bifurcation in a first-order system, providing insights into the conditions for bifurcation.
