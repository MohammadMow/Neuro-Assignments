## Neuroscience of Learning, Memory, Cognition
# Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to the neuroscience of learning, memory, and cognition. Some key topics that will be covered include:

- Neuronal network models including feedforward and recurrent networks
- Synaptic plasticity and different forms of neural learning
- Encoding and decoding of information in neural spike patterns
- Reinforcement learning and associative memory formation
- Decision making models and relations to mind and consciousness

The course will take a computational and quantitative perspective. It will introduce mathematical and machine learning concepts that are useful for understanding neural data and building models of the brain.

## Syllabus
The course is divided into three parts:

# Part I: Neuronal Networks
- Neuron models - Integrate-and-fire, dynamic models
- Network models - Feedforward, recurrent architectures
- Synaptic plasticity and learning mechanisms
# Part II: The Neural Code
- Encoding of information in spike patterns
- Decoding spike events to infer stimuli
- Information theory concepts - Entropy, mutual information
# Part III: Learning, Memory, Decision
- Reinforcement learning - Actor-critic models
- Associative memory - Formation and recall
- Decision making models, relation to mind and consciousness
# Math and Machine Learning Topics
Concepts from fields like linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning that are relevant for computational neuroscience will be covered, including:

- Principal component analysis
- Generative models
- Bayesian inference
- Reinforcement learning
- Information theory concepts

The goal is to equip students with the skills to understand and apply theoretical neuroscience as well as analyze and model real neural data.
