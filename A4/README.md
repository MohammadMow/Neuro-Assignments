## Neuroscience Homework 4
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for the forth homework assignment in the Neuroscience, Learning, Memory, and Cognition course at Sharif University of Technology.

## Modeling Neurons
This homework assignment involves modeling neurons using Python.

# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to gain a basic understanding of how neurons encode sensory input through modeling them computationally. We will create a simple sinusoidal input and feed it to a spiking leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model to observe its firing behavior.

# Tasks
The key tasks in this assignment are:

- Import necessary Python packages for modeling and plotting
- Create a sinusoidal input signal
- Implement the LIF neuron model using Euler integration
- Simulate the neuron model over time with the input
- Plot the membrane potential and spikes over time
- Analyze the firing behavior and relationship to input
